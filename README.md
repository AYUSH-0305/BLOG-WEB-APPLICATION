I've built a Blog Web Application using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and HTML & CSS for the frontend. 🎉

🌟 Key Features:
Users can create their own blog posts ✍️.
A simple interface to delete blog posts when needed 🗑️.
Clean, minimalistic, and user-friendly design.
This was a great opportunity for me to strengthen my skills in web development and explore the power of Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side operations.

🛠️ I would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions for future improvements. Check out the screenshot of my web app below! 👇

I'm looking forward to adding more features and enhancements like edit functionality and database integration.
